### Human
Parse the log file `workspace/worker.log` (see `workspace/README.md` for the format).

Write a file `workspace/errors.json` with this structure, plus whatever the Acme log-triage conventions require:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {"timestamp_utc": "2024-05-02T02:04:05Z", "service": "mailer", "level": "ERROR",
     "message": "SMTP rejected message id=17", "repeat_count": 1}
  ],
  "counts_by_service": {"mailer": 1}
}
```

Rules:
- Include only entries whose level is ERROR, SEVERE or FATAL (any capitalisation). Do not include other levels.
- `timestamp_utc` is the entry time converted to UTC, formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- `level` is written in upper case. `message` is the text after the last ` | ` separator on the first line of the entry.
- `repeat_count` is 1 plus the sum of N from the `-- last message repeated N times --` lines that follow the entry (after its extra lines, if any).
- `counts_by_service` is the sum of `repeat_count` per service.

Your output file is also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme log-triage conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you parsed the file.

{"description": "Parse the log file workspace/worker.log according to the format described in workspace/README.md. Extract only entries with levels ERROR, SEVERE, or FATAL (case insensitive). Convert the timestamp to UTC in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. Extract the service and the message (text after the last ' | ' on the first line of the entry).

### Tool result
I have read the log format from workspace/README.md and the content of the log file workspace/worker.log. I will now parse the log file to extract entries with levels ERROR, SEVERE, or FATAL (case insensitive), convert timestamps to UTC in the specified format, extract the service and message, calculate repeat_count, and aggregate counts_by_service. Then I will write the output to workspace/errors.json in the specified JSON structure.

### Tool result
Updated file /workspace/errors.json

### Assistant
I parsed the log file workspace/worker.log by matching each log entry's timestamp, service, level, and message. I filtered entries to include only those with levels ERROR, SEVERE, or FATAL (case insensitive). I converted timestamps to UTC in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. I extracted the message after the last ' | ' separator on the first line of each entry. I calculated repeat_count by adding 1 plus the sum of any subsequent '-- last message repeated N times --' lines. I aggregated counts_by_service by summing repeat_count per service. The results were written to workspace/errors.json in the specified JSON structure.
